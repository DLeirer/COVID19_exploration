# COVID19_exploration
For the complete code and analysis see notebook entitled "COVID19_europe". 
This file is uploaded as an ".html" and ".ipynb" file. 

The core plots can be seen in the files "plotly_corona_dynamic_graphs.html" and "plotly_corona_world_bank_scatter.html".
I recommend reading the full notebook though if you have any questions regarding how the data was processed.
